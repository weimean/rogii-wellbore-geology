# ROGII Wellbore Geology Prediction

Kaggle Featured Code Competition — predict **TVT** (True Vertical Thickness, ft) for the
post-Prediction-Start evaluation zone of horizontal wells. Metric: **RMSE**.
Final deadline: **Aug 5, 2026**.

## Hard constraints
- Notebook-only submission, ≤9h CPU/GPU, internet disabled.
- Output must be `submission.csv` with columns `id, tvt` (eval-zone rows only).
- External data / pre-trained models allowed if uploaded as a dataset.

## Repo layout
```
src/           data.py  features.py  validation.py  model.py  submit.py
configs/       one YAML per experiment
notes/         working notes (EDA, per-approach analysis via the rubric)
experiments/   log.md — terse per-run ledger (CV RMSE, keep/drop)
data/raw/      train/ (773 wells × 3 files each) · test/ (3 example wells)
```

## Key domain facts
- Eval zone = contiguous NaN tail of TVT_input (~74% of well on median).
- Core signal: GR cross-correlation — horizontal GR is a shifted copy of the
  vertical typewell GR. Self-correlation (own pre-PS GR) > typewell > offset wells.
- Trajectory columns: MD, X, Y, Z. Formation tops (ANCC…BUDA) are train-only.
- Typewell has columns: TVT, GR, Geology.

## Validation discipline
- **Always split by well** (`GroupKFold` on `WELLNAME`). Never leak rows across folds.
- Report grouped-by-well CV RMSE. Trust CV over the stub public LB.

## Workflow
- One config YAML per experiment; log every run in `experiments/log.md`.
- Per-approach narrative in `notes/approaches/NN-name.md` (idea → validation → conclusion).
- Manage deps with `uv sync`; run with `uv run python -m src.submit --config <cfg>`.

## What's been done
- Pipeline verified end-to-end (data → predict → submit). Baseline = ffill / linear_interp
  (both degenerate to flat last-known TVT since eval zone is a tail, not an interior gap).
- Next: GR cross-correlation alignment (self-correlation first, then typewell).
